<p>
Octoblu allows you to connect people, devices, software applications and sensors together and create automations with the internet of things.
</p>
<p>
One new feature we added to the platform is the ability to forward data from things that have been connected to Octoblu to a 3rd party data storage platform of your choice.
</p>
<p>
  We added this feature for several reasons, the main ones being:
<ol>
  <li>We believe individuals and companies should own their IoT data and it should be portable to the data storage and analytics providers of their choice.
</li>
  <li>Customers can use the data and apply analytics and machine learning to create powerful autonomic feedback loops that power self healing systems
    <br>
    Some real world examples are:
    <ul>
    <li>Security applications that monitor system access logs from a tool such as Splunk and combine that with geo-location and revoke access to an authorized entry from an unrecognized location.
    </li>
    <li>
    Safety systems that monitor equipment in real-time and shut down a system if it is operating outside normal operating ranges such as Nuclear Power Plants.
    </li>
  </li>
</p>
<p>
Pre-requisites: You will need an Octoblu account in order to use the data-forwarding feature.  if you do not have one go to  https://app.octoblu.com/signup to create a new one.
